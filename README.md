# JasmineColorTheme

*> Espresso Inspired ultimate Vim colorscheme*

## Info

I have looked through plenty of light themes, but none of them felt pleasing
enough to me. So I decided to roll my own theme. As I sifted through the light
themes for code editors in general, I got heavily inspired by the Espresso Code
Editor. And that is what gave the beginning to this theme.

This theme is carefully crafted to be easy on the eyes. It is not a 100% copy
of Espresso, it is in a sence an extension of it. I have tried to eliminate
most of the Espresso CSSEdit theme shortcomings such as markdown coloring, adding
improved support for `Pangloss/javascript` syntax definition and trying to make
it as logically consistent as I could in other languages such as `python`,
`ruby`, `C++` and `Java`.
