# JasmineColorTheme

*> Espresso Inspired ultimate Vim colorscheme*

## Info

I have looked through plenty of light themes, but none of them felt pleasing
enough to me. So I decided to roll my own. As I sifted through the light
themes for code editors in general, I got heavily inspired by the one used in
Espresso and it gave the beginning to this theme.

Jasmine is carefully crafted to be easy on the eyes. It is not a 100% copy
of Espresso, it is in a sence an extension of it. I have tried to eliminate
most of the Espresso CSSEdit theme shortcomings such as markdown coloring, adding
improved support for `Pangloss/javascript` syntax definition and trying to make
it as logically consistent as I could in other languages such as `Python`,
`Ruby`, `C++`, `Java` and `Haskell`.

## Installation

**Option 1:** Use Vundle or NeoBundle *(Preferred)*

Add this to your `.vimrc`

_If you use Vundle:_

```
Plugin 'nonlogicaldev/vim-jasmine-colortheme'
```

_If you use NeoBundle:_

```
NeoBundle 'nonlogicaldev/vim-jasmine-colortheme'
```

**Option 2:** The 'hardcore' Manual way

Copy the files from `colors` folder into your `~/.vim/colors`
